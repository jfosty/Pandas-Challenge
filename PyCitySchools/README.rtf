# JENNIFER FOSTER HW
# Module 4: Panda Data Frames
# Due 10/28/2024

# I referenced https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.1/generated/pandas.cut.html#:~:text=Use%20cut%20when%20you%20need,pre%2Dspecified%20array%20of%20bins for the cut portion of the assignment 
# I also referenced the professor's skeleton file 
# I am not printing the calculations as they go but only the final tables/DataFrames. If we are supposed to print calcualtions as we go, I can update the code accordingly but it seems like the report is only concerned with the data tables.
